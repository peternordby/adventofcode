# Advent of Code

I have created a repository containing my solutions for Advent of Code. I started participating in Advent of Code during my first year of university to practice problem-solving and to learn Python. This is mainly for fun, and most of the solutions have not been optimized for efficiency or refactored for readability. I have also created some helper functions for reading input via network requests and reading files.

From 2023 and onwards, you can run the solution for day x with:
```
python d[x].py
```
or
```
python d[x].py [file]
```
to test inputs where [file] represents the filename for the .txt containing the example.

Happy holidays! ❄
